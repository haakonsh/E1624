Repo for bachelor thesis project for group E1624 at NTNU/HiST.

This repo contains the firmware for nRF52. 
It's an ultra low power BLE stepcounter utilizing an ADXL362 accellerometer to put the nRF52 to sleep when the accelleration drops below a certain threshold and wakes it up when it goes above another threshold.
The stepcounter is implemented with a on-chip comparator which input signal is driven by a piezo buzzer mounted in the heel of a shoe. 
This piezo buzzer also powers the circuit through an LTC3588-1, an energy harvesting solution ment for piezo elements. 

Project should compile with one warning if extracted correctly into the SDK.
